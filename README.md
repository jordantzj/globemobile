I wanted to create a little digital version of a travel journal that tracks the countries I visited:) 

For this project, Typescript, React Native, and Expo are used for the Frontend. For the Backend, Node.js is used with MongoDB as the database.

This is what it looks like, going for the notion vibe LOL.
